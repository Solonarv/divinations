# The Great Web

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Solonarv/the-great-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Solonarv/the-great-web)

A Minecraft mod, currently in very early development.

Above the clouds, light streams across the world. The streams meet and connect, forming
nodes and faces (always triangular). 

Implemented features:

 - (none)

Partially implemented features:

 - Locators: items that allows you to find nearby things (blocks/entities/structures). The basic system for them is in place,
   but there is no way to create them without `/give` and the system needs to be "filled in" with search filters.
 - ~~Web nodes: entities that are attracted/repulsed by certain nearby blocks and make up the Great Web.~~

Planned features:

 - Procedurally generate the Great Web
 - Add a way to see/render the Web
 - Add things the player can *do* with the Web
