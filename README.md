# The Great Web

A Minecraft mod, currently in very early development.

Flows of magical energy crisscross across the world, forming a Great Web that connects everything.

Implemented features:

 - (none)

Partially implemented features:

 - Locators: items that allows you to find nearby things (blocks/entities/structures). The basic system for them is in place,
   but there is no way to create them without `/give` and the system needs to be "filled in" with search filters.

Planned features:

 - Procedurally generate the Great Web
 - Add a way to see/render the Web
 - Add things the player can *do* with the Web
